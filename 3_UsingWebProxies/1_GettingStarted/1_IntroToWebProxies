~~~ Intro to Web Proxies ~~~
testing web requests to back-end servers is a big part of webapp pentesting

proxies allow us to capture requests/traffics passing between apps and back-end
	servers, and manipute these requests for testing

~~~ What are Web Proxies? ~~~
specialized tools set up between a browser and back-end server to capture/view
	requests being sent between both ends; MTM tool
while Wireshark analyzes all local traffic, web proxies mainly work with web ports

we can intercept a request, modify the data, and see how the back-end handles the new request

~~~ Uses of Web Proxies ~~~
in addition to capturing and replaying HTTP requests, web proxies are used for:
vulnerability scanning, fuzzing, crawling, application mapping, request analysis,
	configuration testing, code reviews

~~~ Burp Suite ~~~
most common web proxy with many user-friendly features, some of which, though, are
	limited to the Pro/Enterprise versions; free version is extremely powerful

~~~ OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) ~~~
- another common proxy tool
advantage is that it's free/open-source so no limit or throttling in scans that wouldn't
	be in place with a subscription

both work well, it just depends on the situation
