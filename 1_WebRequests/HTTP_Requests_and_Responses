~~~ HTTP Requests and Responses ~~~

A request is made by a client and processed by the server, containing all details we require from the server,
	including the resource, data, headers, options, etc.

Once the server receives the request, it reutnrs a response, containing a status code, data, etc.


~~~ HTTP Request ~~~

Method - HTTP method or verb, which specifieds the type of action to perform	GET	
Path - path to resource being accessed, can also contain query string	/users, /login.html?username=user
Version - denotes the HTTP version	HTTP/1.1

Headers such as Host, User-Agent, Cookie, specify more request attributes
They are terminated with a new line, which is necessary for the server to validate the request

* HTTP 1.x sends request as clear-text while HTTP 2.x sends request as binary data in dictionary form *



~~~ HTTP Response ~~~

First line has HTTP version and response code	HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Next few lines contain headers and potential response body, usually defined as HTML code, but could
	be other formats such as JSON, images, style sheets, etc...

Network tab is responsible for web requests: displays status, method, resource (path), etc.
