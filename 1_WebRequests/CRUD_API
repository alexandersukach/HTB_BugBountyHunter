~~~ CRUD API ~~~

~~~ APIs ~~~
- many used to interact with a database to specify requested table and row within API query; then
	to use an HTTP method to perform the needed operation

It's very valuable to research all endpoints of an API as to know proper operations to perform


~~~ CRUD ~~~
Create POST - add specified data to database table
Read GET - retrieve specified entity from database table
Update PUT - updates data of specified database table
Delete DELETE - removes specified row from database table

Same principle works with REST APIs, but they still vary from one another


~~~ READ ~~~

We can simply specify table and search term (you need to know the database structure for this)
We can pipe output to jq utility for proper formatting
-s: flag silences any unneeded cURL output

curl -s http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/api.php/city/london | jq

(Leave city/ empty string to search for all entries)


~~~ CREATE ~~~

We can use POST method and supply data using -d flag, ensuring Content-Type is JSON

curl -X POST 94.237.54.190:43236/api.php/city/ -d '{"city_name":"HTB_City", "country_name":"HTB"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
Then search for it as above


~~~ UPDATE ~~~
PUT updates API entries and modifies their details
* PATCH updates only part of an entry (ie city_name) while PUT modifies the entire *

The following line updates the london entry:
curl -X PUT 94.237.54.190:43236/api.php/city/london -d '{"city_name":"New_HTB_City", "country_name":"HTB"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
When we search for london, we are returned []



~~~ DELETE ~~~
This is as easy as reading a city, all you would do is change the method to DELETE
curl -X DELETE  94.237.54.190:43236/api.php/city/HTB_City
