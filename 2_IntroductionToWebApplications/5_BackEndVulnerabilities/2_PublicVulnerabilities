~~~ Public Vulnerabilities ~~~

~~~ Public CVE ~~~
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
- many vulnerabilities are shared publicly and assigned a CVE record and score

* Tip: First step is to identify web app version and search for public exploits *

~~~ Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) ~~~
industry standard for assessing severity of vulnerabilities
dependent on metrics: Base, Temporal, Environmental

Base metric produces score 1-10, modified by applying temporal and environmental

Currently, we have V2 and V3 scoring, with slight difference in categorization of
	vulnerabilities

~~~ Back-end Server Vulnerabilities ~~~
in addition to vulns for web apps, also consider back end component vulns, particularly
	web-server oriented

back end server / database vulns are utilized after gaining local access to the server
this can lead to high privileged access to gain control over other servers within the
	same network
they are not directly exploitable internally, but very critical and must be patched
	upon discovery
