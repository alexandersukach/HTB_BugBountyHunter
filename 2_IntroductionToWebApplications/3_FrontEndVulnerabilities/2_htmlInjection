~~~ HTML Injection ~~~
important to validate and sanitize accepted user input on the front end, in addition to back end

- occurs when unfiltered user input is displayed on the page, either through retreiving previously
	submitting code (retrieving user comment from back end db), or by directly displaying
	unfiltered input through js on the front end

when a user has full control of how their input will be displayed, they can submit html code
	that can be reflected on the page, or used as an external login form that steals credentials, for
	example

~~~ Example ~~~
a input form that can display your name. ex. enter your name, where we can input html code
	<b> HTML injection </b> will display HTML injection as bolded

since everything is carried out on the front end, refreshing the web page would reset everything to normal
