~~~ Sensitive Data Exposure ~~~

since front end components are executed on the client-side, the end user can be put in  danger
	if any vulnerabilities have been exploited


- refers to the availability of sensitive data in clear-text to the end user, usually found in the 
	source code or page source of a web app's front end

sometimes credentials, hashes, links, etc. can be found within source code or imported js code

when assessing a web app, first thing to do is review the page source code to identify 'low hanging fruit'


~~~ Example ~~~

Sometimes, developers will leave test credentials in the source code that may still be valid
	<!- - TOTO: remove test credentials test:test - - >

~~~ Prevention ~~~
front end source code should only contain necessary code for running web app functions, without
	extra code/comments; always review code that will be visible to end-users when developing
	a web app

also important to classify data types and apply controls on what can and can't be exposed on the client-side

use js code packing or obfuscation to reduce chance of exposure
