~~~ Back End Servers ~~~
- hardware and os that hosts all applications necessary to run the web app
the back end server fits in the Data access layer

~~~ Software ~~~
contains three back end components: web server, database, development framework
other components may include hypervisors, containers, and wafs

popular combination of "stacks" for be servers, which containi a specific set of back end components
solution stack - set of subsystems/conponents that create a complete platform such that no additional
	software is needed to support applications (applications run on top of the platform)
Ex.
LAMP - Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP
WAMP - Windows, Apache, MYSQL, PHP
WINS - Windows, IIS, .NET, SQL Server
MAMP - MacOS, Apache, MYSQL, PHP
XAMPP - Cross-Platform, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Perl

*Many different variations*

~~~ Hardware ~~~
power and performance capabilities of the hardware determine web app scalability/responsiveness
big web apps are designed to distribute load over many be servers that do collective work to perform
	the same tasks and deliver web app to the user

web apps may utilize data centers or cloud services instead of a single be server
