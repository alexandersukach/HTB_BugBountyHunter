HTML is at the core of of a web page, containing basic elements that are interpreted and displayed
	by the the browser on the client-side
 - Elements are displayed in a tree form, similar to XML


~~~ URL Encoding ~~~
A browser needs to know the charset in use to properly display a page's content
In URLs, browsers can only use ASCII encoding (alphanumeric and certain special chars)
Therefore, all other characters must be encoded by replacing unsafe characters with % and two
	hexadecimal digits

Common encodings: 
space 	%20
! 	%21
" 	%22
# 	%23
$ 	%24
% 	%25
& 	%26
' 	%27
( 	%28
) 	%29

~~~ Usage ~~~
Each HTML is called a DOM (Document Object Model), defined by the World Wide Web Consortium (WSC) as:
a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and
	 update the content, structure, and style of a document.

Or much simpler:
programming interface representing a webpage structure as a tree of objects


3 parts:
Core DOM - standard model for all document types
XML DOM - standard model for XML documents
HTML DOM - standard model for HTML documents

Basic difference between XML and HTML:
XML - used for storing data as structured information
	<firstNam> Maria </firstName>
	<lastName> Smith </lastName>
HTML - used for representing content
	<font size="3"> Maria Smith </font>


Elements such as document.head or document.h1 in a tree view can be reffered to as DOMs
