Cascading Style Sheets:
stylesheet language used to format/style HTML elements

Easiest when supplying HTML elements with ID's or class names for later reference

~~~ Syntax ~~~
style is defined by {}: element {property : value;}
	Ex. body {
		font-size: 14px;
		}

Properly leveraged syntax can create for advanced animations for a variety of uses


~~~ Usage ~~~
often used alongside JS to dynamically adjust properties of HTML elements (or animations)
	based on keystrokes or mouse cursor location


CSS can be used with other languages, such as XML or within SVG items, to implement their styles



~~~ Frameworks ~~~

Frameworks have been introduced as it can be inefficient to manually set the style of all HTML
	elements in each webpage
- These frameworks contain a collection of sheets and designes making it easier/faster to create
	visually appealing HTML elements
- They are also optimized for web app usage, as they are designed to be used with JS and wide
	use across a web app
Common examples: Boostrap, SASS, Bulma, Pure, Foundation
